# Refined Requirements for Installer File Scraper

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Scrape specified websites for installer files (.exe, .msi, .dmg, .pkg, .deb, .rpm, etc.)
   - Follow links within the domain and subdomains
   - Download files temporarily to process them
   - Generate SHA3 hash for each installer file
   - Delete downloaded files after processing
   - Store metadata to a JSON file

2. **Data Collection**:
   - File name
   - Source URL
   - Parent website domain
   - Discovery timestamp
   - SHA3 hash
   - File size
   - Platform identification (Windows/macOS/Linux)
   - File type/extension

3. **JSON Output**:
   - Append new entries to existing JSON file if present
   - Sort entries (by domain and filename)
   - Ensure no duplicate entries (based on SHA3 hash and URL)
   - Maintain a clean, well-formatted JSON structure

4. **URL Filtering**:
   - Include/exclude patterns using regex
   - Skip URLs matching specific patterns (e.g., forum threads, blog posts)
   - Whitelist certain URL patterns for prioritized crawling
   - Filter by file path components
   - Option to limit crawling to specific subdirectories

5. **Customizable Concurrency**:
   - Configurable number of crawler goroutines
   - Adjustable parallel download limit
   - Separate controls for crawling and downloading concurrency
   - Configurable rate limiting per domain
   - Domain-specific concurrency settings (optional)

6. **Configuration Options**:
   - Starting URL(s)
   - Maximum crawl depth
   - Target file extensions
   - URL inclusion/exclusion regex patterns
   - Output JSON file path
   - Temporary download directory
   - Concurrency parameters
   - Request delays/rate limits

7. **Operation**:
   - Clean up all temporary files, even on error or interruption
   - Track and log progress
   - Provide statistics on completion (files found, processed, errors)
   - URL pattern matching statistics (how many URLs skipped/included)

8. **Efficiency and Resilience**:
   - Implement appropriate timeouts
   - Handle network errors with configurable retries
   - Memory-efficient processing of large files
   - Graceful shutdown on interrupt signals

The application will be a self-contained Go program with robust URL filtering capabilities to efficiently focus the crawling on productive paths, avoiding unnecessary requests to irrelevant URLs and thereby improving overall performance and reducing crawl time.

Architecture Options for Installer File Scraper
Let me outline different architectural approaches we could take for this application:
1. Monolithic Single-Binary Approach
Structure:

Single executable with all functionality
Configuration via command-line flags or config file
Direct flow from crawling to processing to output

Components:

Main coordinator
URL crawler
File detector/downloader
Hash generator
JSON handler

Pros:

Simple deployment (single binary)
No external dependencies beyond Go standard library and colly
Easy to understand flow
Lower overhead

Cons:

Less modular
Potentially harder to test individual components
All operations in same process space

2. Pipeline Architecture
Structure:

Series of stages with channels connecting them
Each stage operates independently
Data flows through unidirectional channels

Components:

URL discovery pipeline
Download queue pipeline
Processing pipeline
Output persistence pipeline

Pros:

Better separation of concerns
Independent scaling of different stages
More testable components
Easier to optimize bottlenecks

Cons:

More complex implementation
Requires careful channel management
Potential for deadlocks if not designed carefully

3. Worker Pool Architecture
Structure:

Central job queue
Multiple worker types for different tasks
Coordinator to manage workers

Components:

Job dispatcher
Crawler workers
Downloader workers
Processor workers
Output manager

Pros:

Excellent for controlling concurrency
Can dynamically adjust worker counts
Good for handling diverse workloads
More robust error isolation

Cons:

More complex state management
Overhead of queue management
Requires more careful synchronization

4. Event-Driven Architecture
Structure:

Components communicate via events
Each component subscribes to relevant events
Loose coupling between parts

Components:

Event bus
URL discoverer
File detector
Downloader
Hash generator
Metadata collector
JSON writer

Pros:

Very loose coupling
Highly extensible
Easy to add new features
Good separation of concerns

Cons:

More complex to implement in Go
Potential overhead from event handling
Harder to reason about program flow

5. Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Structure:

Pipeline-based core with worker pools for CPU/IO-bound tasks
Centralized coordination
Configurable worker counts per stage

Components:

URL Queue Manager
Crawler worker pool
Downloader worker pool
File processor worker pool
JSON persistence manager

Pros:

Combines benefits of pipeline and worker pool approaches
Flexible concurrency control
Good separation of concerns
Efficient resource utilization

Cons:

Moderate complexity
Requires careful design of interfaces between components

This hybrid approach would give us the flexibility to control concurrency at different stages while maintaining a clear data flow through the system.
